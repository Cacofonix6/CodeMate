This project was created in Eclipse.
To run in eclipse:
 - Import the CodeMate folder into the work space
 - Run from GUI.java which can be found in the "core" package

This will run the Console GUI used for debugging.

The executable jar file can be run from command line by running:

	java -jar CodeMate.jar

This will run the Console GUI used for debugging.
You can skip the debugging GUI by giving it a directory:

	java -jar CodeMate.jar "<Directory>"

This will run the analysis on the given directory and output a report if it is, or contains .java files.
